# High g-load five-word premises

1. BOTH-CURRENTS invert axes T+2 budgets
2. QUANTUM-MAPS cascade TWICE-LATER phase-ledgers invariants
3. MEMORY-LATTICE remembers forgetting OVER-AGAIN couplings
4. EACH-AXIS resonate counterphase NOW-THEN budgets
5. PARADOX-LOOPS prevent causes BEFORE-THEN echoes
6. ROTATION-MEMORIES split SELF-MIRRORS T-1 reservoirs
7. FEEDBACK-CURRENTS merge BOTH-STATES T+3 invariants
8. LOGIC-WAVES invert evidence T+1 memory-frames
